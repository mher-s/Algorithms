# Binary Search

## How it works ?

Binary 

If an element you’re
looking for is in that list, binary search returns the position
where it’s located by dividing by half.

### Exercises

- Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching
  through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of
  steps it would take?

> Initial is 128 then 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 - 7 Steps

- Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum
  number of steps now?

> Initial is 256 then 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 - 8 Steps
